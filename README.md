### Algorithm ðŸ’¡
The idea is to construct Array of profits comparing to price 10 (in Holland) .So accumulating profit
for array : 12 3 10 7 16 5 is : -2 5 5 8 2 7.In this aray maximum is 8 and the fluts are 4.
When we have schuurs bigger than 1 ,then we find maximum value for every list and list of
positions in case of equal max elements.Then we need to sum the profits of all lists and
sum all combinations ,taking into account first 10 sums.
